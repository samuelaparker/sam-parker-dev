This is some of my story. I hope it gives you some context and insight into who I am.

I flirted with learning to code for a long time before actually starting. Back in 2016 I was having an existential crisis and was questioning my commitment to a music career. I was desperately seeking direction in my life. I remember asking my friend’s Mom for advice. “Should I go all in on learning to code or continue to focus on music?” She had had a long career in the corporate world working for Apple in the 1990’s and banks and had foregone a potential career as a violinist for a profession with stability. Her advice was: focus on music for a couple more years and then decide. 

At the time I had been dabbling in the freecodecamp(link) Responsive Web Design track and was enjoying it but not particularly understanding what it was I was doing. I was just zipping through the exercises without fully absorbing or contextualizing the information. Here is a screenshot of the first page I created: (link to image)

My foray into HTML and CSS was abandoned and for the next three years I shifted my energy and focus onto music. I dove deep into music using Ableton(link), to create two records that I wrote, recorded and mixed. You can find them here: (link to bandcamp)
I’m proud of the art I created and music will always be an integral part of my story and who I am.
