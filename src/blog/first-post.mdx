## Overview:
The intention of this blog is to cover some technical topics but this first post is all about me, me, me! This is some context and a view of my experiences in programming and design.

## Backstory:
I spent my twenties searching and wandering. When I graduated with a degree in jazz piano from the Hartt School of Music in 2010 my heart and mind were filled with a potent blend of optimism and nativity mixed with a healthy portion of entitlement. I didn’t know where I was going but I had a feeling things were going to turn out wonderfully for me. 

My twenties slipped by so quickly. I think by the end of them I was a bit surprised by how my life had turned out and I was disappointed in myself. It was an identity crisis. I had put all my eggs in one basket so to speak. I had always considered myself a musician first above all things. That was my identity. When my career didn’t work out the way I thought it would I felt like a failure. It was depressing because I knew I had the talent to make a career but I had failed to muster up the drive. 

My thinking shifted around the age of thirty. I realized I had been telling myself some lies. I had always believed since high-school that music was the only thing that I was good at. I believed that I wasn’t smart enough to study computer science or learn how to program. I believed that my value was linked with my success in music. 

- I had to replace these lies in my mind with the truth: 
- I have the intelligence to learn how to code. 
- It’s okay to learn and do things other than music.
- My identity doesn’t come from my career but it comes from Jesus. 
- My purpose is love.

I flirted with learning to code for a long time before actually starting. Back in 2016 when I was questioning my commitment to a music career and was desperately seeking direction in my life, I remember asking a friend’s Mom: “Should I go all in on learning to code as a career or continue to focus on music?” 

Her career had been with Apple in the 90’s and then banking institutions and she had abandoned a potential career as a violinist around the same age as me asking. Her advice was: focus on music for a couple more years and then decide.
At the time I had been dabbling in the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) Responsive Web Design track and was enjoying it but not particularly understanding what it was I was doing. I was just zipping through the exercises without fully absorbing or contextualizing the information. 

My foray into HTML and CSS was put aside and for the next three years I shifted my energy and focus back into music. Using [Ableton](https://www.ableton.com/) I recorded and mixed two records. You can [find them here](https://sambrosiamusic.bandcamp.com/).
I’m proud of the art I created and I plan to continue recording and playing for life. My connection to music is more holistic now and I feel as if I have a healthy perspective on it now that it’s un-linked with my identity and personal value. 

Design Beginnings: 
In May of 2019 I found myself randomly curious about Photoshop. I was home visiting my parents in Maine and I had this impulse to dive into the adobe suite. I’m not sure what piqued my curiosity but I had questions. How do you use it? What can you do with it? I really enjoyed digging into Photoshop and from there I was off on an epic learning and discovery journey into an entire new realm!! Yay!!

From Photoshop I moved to exploring Illustrator and it was around this time I discovered the field of UX/UI/product design. Keep in mind I had no office or corporate experience at this time. My jobs had always been in the service industry (coffee shops/bars/jazz club) or had been playing piano gigs or djing. I was at my job at the Village Vanguard chatting with a coworker when she mentioned a friend who worked as a UX designer. I had never heard of this career before but it intrigued me because this person was able to audition for acting gigs in between UX projects.

As it turned out I already knew a product designer! My friend [Will Lenzen](https://willlenzenjr.com/). He graciously agreed to share his knowledge with me very helpfully pointing me to some resources that got me started. One resource was this great youtube channel called [Flux](https://www.youtube.com/c/FluxWithRanSegall/featured) run by a fantastic designer named Ran Segall. I found his channel very valuable and it’s where I discovered a cool tool for building websites called [Webflow](https://webflow.com/). I wanted to dig into Webflow but I was still curious about UX/UI/product design so I worked through this [product design course](https://www.udacity.com/course/product-design--ud509)  on Udemy from Google. I was introduced to design principles and concepts like user testing, user flow, and user centered design.

I was off and running and I dove deep into Webflow and found their [educational materials and tutorials](https://university.webflow.com/lesson) to be delightful and surprisingly humorous.  So much to be mined here. 

During the months that I studied Webflow I reached out to a past co-worker of mine named [Dave C Franke](https://www.davecfrankel.com/) at the Village Vanguard who had pursued a career in design and was now running a successful design agency called [Virgo](https://www.virgo-ny.com/) as well as teaching at [Parsons School of design](https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/) in Manhattan. He gave me some book recommendations. I purchased and read: 

- [Grid Systems In Graphic Design](https://www.amazon.com/Grid-systems-graphic-design-communication/dp/3721201450) by Josef Müller-Brockmann

- [The Elements of Typographic Style](https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Version-Anniversary/dp/0881792128/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1EFETVF1EYMVI&dchild=1&keywords=elements+of+typographic+style&qid=1624911194&s=books&sprefix=elements+of+typ%2Cstripbooks%2C154&sr=1-1) by Robert Bringhurst

- [Thinking With Type](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Type-2nd-revised-expanded/dp/1568989695/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3UGWWW5Q11Z6O&dchild=1&keywords=thinking+with+type&qid=1624911222&s=books&sprefix=thinking+with+%2Cstripbooks%2C158&sr=1-1) by Ellen Lupton

- [Creative Strategy and the Business of Design](https://www.amazon.com/Creative-Strategy-Business-Design-Douglas/dp/1440341559/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2MHBBK2DANU2R&dchild=1&keywords=creative+strategy+and+business+of+design&qid=1624911260&s=books&sprefix=creative+stra%2Cstripbooks%2C161&sr=1-1) by Douglas Davis

A few of these books are design classics and I gained a ton of valuable information from them. I might give a breakdown of each title in a future article.

## My First Clients! 
After creating my first personal website with Webflow. I began reaching out to potential clients. I started by researching some businesses in my neighborhood in Brooklyn. If I noticed that their website needed polishing or wasn’t responsive for mobile I drew up a proposal and dropped it off with a manager or owner at the business. At the time I was frustrated because it was difficult to build trust and authority without having much experience. In retrospect I realize the act of creating proposals and researching businesses was experience in itself. 

February 2020 was a milestone month. I got my first paying client! I met them at a superbowl party funny enough. Solid anecdotal evidence that networking is everything. We had our first meeting that next week and I was hired to create a website! The site was for an events agency in NYC called Collabaret and I created their site with Webflow. You can [see it here](https://www.collabaretcreative.com/).
My clients were pleased with the site and I gained a lot of knowledge from the work I did. This was my first experience with custom forms, CMS and client relations.

## Practicing Programming Makes Presentable.
I enjoyed using Webflow but I still wanted to learn to code. When the pandemic started and the world shut down I knew that this was an opportunity to dig in. I did some research online and kept seeing [Harvard’s CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/fall/) pop up in recommendations. Fundamentals are important and since I had no knowledge of programming concepts I decided to choose a course that provided an overview.  CS50 fit the bill. 

CS50 was very challenging. The lectures are long and the course work is intended to be difficult. I found myself questioning if I was cut out for programming. Fortunately my friend Percy had worked through the class and he encouraged me by saying “this is hard material, just keep going.” Thanks Percy! I took my time with the coursework and lectures and the concepts began to make sense. I learned a lot about perseverance,  breaking down difficult problems, and pushing through frustration. I also experienced the rush that comes from writing code that works! It’s quite addictive! CS50 also changed the way I see the world by peeling back the layers and abstractions in the technology we use every day and take for granted. The class has become legendary because of professor David J. Malan’s efforts and I recommend the class to anyone learning to code.

After finishing CS50 it was time to celebrate! Yay! Ok. now, time to keep learning. 
## Javascript. 
I decided to work through another recommended class on Udemy called [The Complete JavaScript Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/) by Jonas Schmedtmann. 

Since I had been studying design with a focus on web design it made sense to move towards front end development. 
I worked through this course over four months. It’s quite comprehensive and I wanted to absorb as much as possible. I supplemented the course with two books:
[HTML & CSS: Design and Build Websites](https://www.amazon.com/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189) by Jon Duckett 
And
[Eloquent JavaScript](https://eloquentjavascript.net/) by Marijn Haverbeke

## React.
Onwards to [React](https://reactjs.org/)!  
I found another highly rated Udemy class called [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/) by Stephen Grider.  
At this point I was getting a bit tired of coding along with tutorials. Tutorial hell I think they call it.. I had some other Webflow clients so I put the Redux part of the course on hold. 

The time is now January 2021 and I’ve been coding for a solid year! It was around this time that I discovered an amazing course from the University of Helsinki called [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) 
Full Stack Open is an incredible curriculum that uses mastery learning to teach full stack web development. I found this highly organized method of learning very effective and appreciated the challenge of the course. I found it’s method of assigning challenges (homework essentially) helped me internalize concepts better than a code along video lesson.
## First coding job!
I had a breakthrough in April when I got my first contract work writing code! I was hired by a startup called Subtonic.io to write a React component that uses a HTML canvas to render a piano keyboard according to MIDI input. This was a big step for me especially since the CTO, a brilliant developer named Miles Aaron agreed to mentor me. 
## In conclusion: 
I’ve learned so much! I’m proud of how far I’ve come, especially since I’m self-taught. I’m also humbled by the sheer enormity of the programming field. 
What’s next? Practice and experience! I want to be a valuable asset for the companies and individuals I work with. I’ve set the foundation and now it’s time to build. This personal site (samparker.dev) built on Gatsby will be a platform to showcase my writing and code experiments.
