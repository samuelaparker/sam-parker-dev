        Hi, my name is Sam Parker.

      <Paragraph>
        Over the past 3 years, I've worked on diverse client projects including marketing websites for software development agencies and fintech web applications. Iâ€™ve honed my skills in Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, and Typescript and am always deepening my knowledge of software engineering. I value clean code and efficient teamwork. My multidisciplinary background equips me to handle new challenges and I enjoy collaborating and learning from talented colleagues.
